# ALGORITHM

- Step-1 :- START
- Step-2 :- Create a class named as `days`.
- Step-3 :- Create a method named as `main` and declare the Scanner class. Declare the variables- `n`,`day`,`year`- of integer type to store the number of days, calculated days and year respectively. Create an array named `a` of integer type in order to store the names of the 12 months orderwise. Check whether the year entered is a leap year or not, if true then store the number of days in the month of February as 29 else store it as 28. Using multiple for-loops store the calculated days in the variable `day` and the year in the variable `year`. Finally print the calculated date,month and y
- Step-4 :- END
