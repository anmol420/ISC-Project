# ALGORITHM

- Step-1 :- START
- Step-2 :- Create a class named as `Disarium`.
- Step-3 :- Declare variables - `num` to store the number and `size` to store the size of the number.
- Step-4 :- Create a constructor named as `Disarium` to initialize the variables to initial values.
- Step-5 :- Create a method named as `countDigits` to count the number of digits in the number.
- Step-6 :- Create a method named as `sumofDigits` with two interger type parameters to return the sum of the digits of the number.
- Step-7 :- Create a method named as `check` to check whether the number is a disarium number and display the result with an appropriate message.
- Step-8 :- Create a method named as `main` to to create an object and call the functions accordingly to enable the task.
- Step-9 :- END
